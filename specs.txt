SPECS

1.  keyword: null, wordbank: null = output: "please input a keyword and a wordbank"
    this is the simplest input/output combo; null.

2. keyword: "hi", wordbank: null = output: "please input a keyword and a wordbank"
   this checks the same function with a keyword input.

3. keyword: "hi", wordbank: "you" = output: "hi: 0"
   now we have two inputs but no matching words.

4. keyword: "hi", wordbank: "hi" = output: "hi: 1"
   now we have 1 repeat, checking out repeat counter.
   //I decided to skip this spec because it didn't effect the function

5. keyword: "hi", wordbank: "hi you" = output: "hi: 1"
   now we have 1 repeated word, with multiple words in the wordbank.

6. keyword: "hi", wordbank: "hi you hi" = output: "hi: 2"
   now we have 1 repeated word, repeated more than once in the wordbank.

7. keyword: "HI", wordbank: "hi you hi" = output: "hi: 2"
   this is checking for capitalization in the keyword input field.

8. keyword: "hi", wordbank: "Hi you hi" = output: "hi: 2"
   this is checking for capitalization in the wordbank input field.
